Project Ronin is a private source attempt at rewriting and cleaning up the internal systems of Ascent based Emulation.

Rather than continue to update this emulator privately, I've decided to dump my source back onto Github where anyone can use or contribute to it.

There is no database, sorry. Creating one from a mangos based cataclysm project is incredibly easy though, as the core has internal support for table based data modification.

Hardware this core's fulltilt mode is (over)optimized for:

64-bit Server Enviroment
Intel® Core™ i7-5820K CPU @ 3.27GHz
AMD Ryzen™ 5 1600 CPU @ 3.19GHz
8GB RAM Minimum (12 Recommended)
