Use CMake to target the cmake subdirectory, after that use cmake to generate compiler files in the directory of your choice.

If the directory you choose is a subdirectory of the repository checkout, cmake will generate a file in the root directory of that repo checkout and tell git to ignore changes in that folder.

After that use your noggin, thanks.
